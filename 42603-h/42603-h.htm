<h1>SAN FRANCISCO<br/>
<small>AND</small><br/>
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.</h1>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Legation of the United States of America,<br/>
San Jose, Costa Rica, Central America</span>,<br/>
September 15, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. George C. Perkins</span>,<br/>
United States Senator,<br/>
San Francisco, California.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">Your valued favor of August 23d requests me to contest
the argument of a mutual friend entitled to our
personal esteem, in regard to the Nicaragua Canal, to
the construction of which he objects. The admission
made by him that <i>his argument is not made on very broad
lines</i> would indispose me to reply, as the Nicaragua Canal
is a national undertaking, not to be considered from a
narrow standpoint. But, confident that even his narrow
premises will not stand impartial investigation, I
shall contest his arguments first from his restricted platform,
and subsequently in the brief manner necessitated
by the limits of this paper, on a broader and more
patriotic basis.</p>

<p class="indent">In examining his statement of navigable distances I
note some serious errors, consequently you will find
herewith a statement thereof for which I can vouch as
emanating from the United States Hydrographic office.
During my Central American residence I have visited
various United States naval ships on this station and
have found one naval lieutenant opposed to the canal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
On urging him to candidly state his reason for this
opposition, he at first stated that his reason was a personal
one and like our friend&#39;s <i>not made on very broad lines</i>.
He finally admitted that he opposed a canal because if
we do not have one we shall need two navies, one on
each side of the Continent; more naval officers would be
necessary and his promotion would ensue much more
rapidly! Although at first surprised at this view of the
case I thanked him for his friendly candor, and replied
that his argument as a <i>personal</i> one was on a sound basis,
much more so than the railway magnates who oppose the
Canal on the erroneous ground that their overland railways
will be injured thereby when I challenge anyone
to cite an instance where any canal has not benefited
the railways nearest thereto: notably the St. Mary&#39;s and
Erie Canals in our own country.</p>

<p class="indent">Our friend starts with the assumption that the canal
is <i>to be constructed for the purpose of making money</i>. This
I deny <i>in toto</i>. The United States Government will
build a canal on a broader and more beneficent basis, for
the <i>political</i> and <i>military safety</i> of our country, for the
<i>development of its commerce and industries</i> and to secure
a <i>short cheap water</i> route to and from our Pacific Ocean
possessions. The Suez Canal which cost ninety-four
millions was built to make money and earns 17 to 20
per cent. annually on a toll of about $1.85 per ton,
whereas our Government should not charge over one
dollar per ton when the Nicaragua Canal is opened and
when its traffic increases, probably half a dollar per ton
will pay cost of maintenance and leave a small percentage
for a sinking fund.</p>

<p class="indent">Secondly, he states &quot;the Canal will have no business
when first opened.&quot; Why not? Will freight continue
to prefer ten thousand miles greater distance around
Cape Horn or higher Panama Railway Route and overland
railway charges? The business of the Canal will
come from new interests which it will develop and from
other routes which cannot compete with it in rates.
Third. He asserts that it will cost no less than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
$150,000,000.00. How much the Canal will cost depends
upon its capacity and its honest construction.
Since the Maritime Canal Company figured on $80,084,176.00
for a 28-feet canal, the majority report of the
United States Commission has increased the <i>possible</i> cost,
including a 20 per cent. contingency to $118,113,790 for
a canal two feet deeper and much wider, with duplicate
locks of increased size. But experts who have investigated
the question have no fear of financial results even
at the cost of one hundred and fifty millions.</p>

<p class="indent">Fourth. I deny that it will <i>be much more expensive to
operate than the Suez Canal</i>, which needs constant dredging
to keep it from filling with desert sands, as against
the nominal cost of operating modern locks at Nicaragua,
proof of which we have in the cost of lockage at the
Saint Mary&#39;s Canal, which now passes through its locks
nearly three times the tonnage that uses the Suez Canal.
Neither is there apprehension of difficulty in water control
at Nicaragua. Nature has provided against this as
any canal engineer who has examined the route can
prove. <i>An abundance of fresh water under absolute control</i>
is the <i>striking advantage</i> developed at Nicaragua, as
against the Suez Canal built through an irreclaimable
sand desert, constantly encroaching upon it and necessitating
constant dredging. But I may remark that the
Suez canal with an expensive staff expends only 8-1/2 per
cent. of gross receipts for management while the cheapest
and most efficient railway in the United States uses
47 per cent. of gross receipts for operating expenses, and
many of our railways between 50 and 60 per cent. This
is one of several reasons why a canal can afford to carry
cheaper than any railway; it has practically <i>no wear and
tear</i>, and <i>no depreciation</i> to contend with.</p>

<p class="indent">Examining carefully the animus of the paper I find
only two main points to contest. First: The Nicaragua
Canal will divert commerce from San Francisco and other
Pacific Coast Ports. Second: It is &quot;outrageous and
inexcusable&quot; that the Government shall create a competing
route which will injure railways overland which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
it has already aided in construction. Having reasoned
from a fallacious standpoint the conclusions are without
foundation and the last one entirely regardless of the
national and public interest. That the Nicaragua Canal
will divert maritime commerce from San Francisco and
other Pacific Coast Ports is a <i>fallacy</i> based upon the
proposition that, with the advantage of five thousand
miles navigation and canal toll in their favor the merchants
of Pacific Coast Ports will be unable to compete
with their Atlantic Coast and European rivals. Such
proposition implies an <i>incompetency</i> which I am not
disposed to admit. It is a fallacy for another reason
connected with navigation. A steamship from Hong
Kong to Western terminus of Nicaragua Canal, and vice
versa, only increases her distance by calling at San
Francisco <i>twenty</i> miles: from Yokohama <i>ninety-one</i>
miles. The steam route from Yokohama to Brito
(Western terminus of Canal) via Honolulu (practically
on rhumb line) is <i>374 miles longer</i> and from Hong Kong
<i>367 miles longer</i>. These two most important ports illustrate
the same fact as applicable to all other Asiatic
Ports within the distance attraction of the Canal, the
<i>divisional line</i> of which from the United States Atlantic
Coast is at <i>Singapore</i>. The carriage of fuel being a serious
factor in steamship expense, and San Francisco being
practically <i>a half-way port</i> on a run of over ten thousand
miles it <i>must</i> become a port of call for coal and freight,
for all steamships in the Atlantic Asiatic trade, unless
such special limited business offers at Hawaii as will induce
them to navigate nearly four hundred miles additional.
Under these conditions these steamships will
often handle California freight to be discharged and replaced
with a <i>second</i> freight for the Atlantic or for
Asiatic Ports while coaling. The increased tonnage
using Pacific Coast Ports for this reason will cheapen
freights and add greatly to the business of its Ports. It
cannot be claimed that steamers will prefer the longest
route. Even between New York and Europe, where
the shortest (or &quot;great circle&quot; route) infringes upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
Cape Race, the transatlantic steamers run that dangerous,
foggy and iceberg line, in preference to the
longer <i>rhumb line</i> further south, to save a much less
distance, and they will certainly do so on the Pacific
where the saving is much greater. I beg attention to
the subjoined third table of distances of proving the assertions
above made.</p>

<p class="indent">That the canal will <i>divert</i> some overland traffic from
the railways is an indisputable fact. There must be a
new adjustment of conditions. But there will arise
with this adjustment a full compensation which will
soon become <i>vastly more important</i> than the long haul
overland of a class of freights which are only carried
overland to avoid the 15,000 miles Cape Horn route.
In the increased, vastly more profitable <i>short haul</i> to and
from Pacific Coast tide water and in the increased passenger
travel consequent upon the rapid development of
the Pacific Coast our overland railways will find full
compensation&mdash;the Canal will be of great benefit to
them. When the short and cheap water way is available,
European shipping to Pacific Ports will be largely
steam freight tonnage. These steamers will load holds
with English cargo and between decks with immigrants,
and the Pacific Coast will rapidly settle up with these to
the exclusion of Chinese. To such desirable emigration
the Pacific Coast will for the first time be accessible
at reasonable rates. At present the few that have the
means to start for the Coast by overland railways are
induced to settle in the middle West, and consequently
Pacific Coast population increases very slowly. The
same freight steamships will then return to Atlantic
Ports, with Pacific Coast products: Cape Horn will become
a memory.</p>

<p class="indent">The United States Government has covered into its
Treasury approximately $113,000,000.00 which it loaned
the overland railways; the enormous land grants they
keep. What &quot;injustice or outrage&quot; is there in <i>again</i>
using this money to build another transportation route,
national in character, for the benefit of all the Republic?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
This is not even taxation of our people: they have
been once taxed to build the overland railways. I have
in mind an instance where 1,500 barrels provisions were
shipped from Sioux City, Iowa, to Jersey City, lightered
to the California bound ship in East River, New York;
carried 15,000 miles around Cape Horn, paying rail
freight Eastward, lighterage, Cape Horn freight, insurance,
six months interest and San Francisco wharfage;
after all these charges saving <i>one third on the rail freight</i>
westward from Sioux City to the Pacific. Freight rates
eastward on Pacific Coast perishable products are even
higher. You are aware that, to save the onerous westward
freight charges by rail, California merchants have
repeatedly shipped heavy goods by steam from our Atlantic
Ports to Antwerp: thence reshipped via Cape
Horn to San Francisco, paying charges before named,
and would be now doing so save for Customs regulations
forbidding it. It cannot be expected that freight can
be carried by rail across the continent more than three
thousand miles over two mountain chains and compete
in cost with water transportation which under conditions
most favorable to rail transportation costs only one-fifth,
while, with heavy grades, the ratio is one by
water to fifteen by rail. In the effort to control such
freight, the overland railways are <i>preventing the development
of the Pacific Coast</i> to their own detriment and
against the interests of our great country. The day
will come when these railway managers will regard their
opposition to the Canal as error born of <i>unfounded apprehension</i>.
Even now one of the main overland railway
systems is quietly friendly to the Canal. Water
transportation has its limitations, mainly <i>cheapness at
the expense of time</i>. Railway transportation also has its
limitations, mainly <i>speed at increased cost</i>. One is the
complement of the other&mdash;not properly its competitor,
and by carriage of cheap and bulky freight which is
frequently unprofitable to railways on a long haul,
water transportation can and is being used to <i>aid</i> railways.
Even Mr. Huntington frequently shipped his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
railway iron around Cape Horn, as he would have done
through the canal had it been available. While controlling
a railway system from ocean to ocean, he
bought out the &quot;Morgan Steamship Company&quot; between
New York and New Orleans and with the advantage
of this <i>one-third water route</i>, dictated terms to his
railway competitors. Could he have better expressed
his true appreciation of cheap water carriage and of the
inter-oceanic canal?</p>

<p class="indent">The limits of this letter forbid a full discussion of
navigation distances, and besides this, distances are not
fully conclusive. Considerations of traffic, ocean currents,
available coaling stations, and return cargoes
must be taken into account. But I shall briefly allude
to prominent points in connection with navigable distances
which are proven by U. S. Hydrographic Tables.
Considering New York as the starting point, the <i>divisional
line</i> between Suez and Nicaragua Canal influence
in Asiatic commerce is <i>Singapore</i>, which port is only 29
miles nearer New York via Suez than Nicaragua. Consequently
<i>all Asiatic Ports north of Singapore</i> are within
the attraction of the American Canal for United States
commerce. The immense trade of these ports is an important
factor. In Australia, all ports East of and including
Melbourne are much nearer New York than via
Suez. New Zealand, the coasts of North and South
America on both oceans and all Pacific Ocean Island
groups the same. No claim to important diversion
from the Suez Canal can be made, as the distance from
the United States to Port Said protects it. Nor is a
claim to diversion from Suez Canal needed. The Nicaragua
Canal had within its zone of attraction, as shown
by careful estimates in 1890, 8,159,150 tons annually.
The revenue attainable therefrom will depend upon rate
of toll, but at one dollar per ton, with 10 per cent. for
operating expenses (or 1-1/2 per cent. more than at Suez)
it will leave a safe sinking fund even on $150,000,000.00
cost, or, by an extension of time, on a greater amount.
But the earnings will rapidly increase. You will note
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
that the Suez Canal merely diverted gradually an <i>ancient</i>
commerce, the increase of which has been steady but
comparatively slow. The Nicaragua Canal can depend
upon an already large commerce, yet in its <i>incipiency</i>.
The resources of the American continent are <i>undeveloped</i>
and its population <i>limited</i>. No man can place a limit
upon the future commerce of this great division of the
habitable world. Another feature in favor of the Nicaragua
Canal is <i>the region through which it will be built</i>.
While its length is 169 miles, it has 121 miles of free
slack water and lake navigation, through a territory of
unsurpassed fertility, blessed with a healthy climate.
Thus, <i>it is not only an inter-oceanic canal but a line of inland
navigation</i> which will so develop the territory on
each side that in a few yew years its commerce will pay
the cost of maintenance. The benefit of a fresh water
canal to ocean carriers of steel or iron will be obvious
to experts: they will leave it with clean bottoms and
boilers filled with fresh water. Its location is 11° North
of the Equator and in the North East trade regions, an
advantage that will enable sailing ships to avail of it.
Cape Horn is twelve hundred miles South of the Cape
of Good Hope and the American Canal consequently
saves greater distances than the Suez or any other canal
that can hereafter be constructed.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>naval</i> and <i>political</i> advantage of the Canal is a
technical question regarding which my opinion is given
with deference. But I find that its opponents are not
found in the Government service. Military and Naval
officers discuss the <i>advisability of fortifying</i> the canal
<i>never doubting its great importance to our country</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Quotations are available to prove that many of our
greatest statesmen have been its ardent advocates, but
space forbids. I may mention among these Grant,
Harrison, Hayes, McKinley and Bryan as well as a
nearly unanimous Senate and House are recorded in its
favor. Are all these great minds dullards on the Canal
question? Are they not the men who <i>ought to understand</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
the great interests of our country, <i>impartially</i> considered?</p>

<p class="indent">As my advocacy for this beneficent work for a quarter
of a century may be regarded as warping my judgment
in its favor, I will end this already too extended reply
by quoting <i>Archibald Ross Colquhoun</i>, an eminent English
Engineer and Government Administrator, who,
having personally examined the Nicaragua Canal route
and the plans adopted for its construction, wrote a
standard work <i>The Key of the Pacific</i> (Longhams, London,
1895) which ends with the following conclusions
(page 335):</p>

<p class="indent">1. It will render greater service to the New World
than the Suez Canal does to the Old.</p>

<p class="indent">2. It will bring Japan, Northern China, Australasia
and part of Malaysia nearer the Atlantic cities of the
United States than they are now to England.</p>

<p class="indent">3. It will benefit America in an infinitely greater
degree than it will Europe, which will only use the
Canal in trading with the Pacific littoral of the two
Americas, the South Sea Islands and possibly New Zealand.</p>

<p class="indent">4. It will divert little or no European traffic from the
Suez Canal.</p>

<p class="indent">5. It will give an immense impulse to United States
manufactures, especially cotton and iron, and will greatly
stimulate the shipbuilding industry and development of
the naval power of the United States.</p>

<p class="indent">6. It will cost more than the estimates show ($80,084,176.00
at that time) but it will have a traffic greater
than is usually admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">7. In the interest of the world it must be neutralized,
and the true policy of the United States is to forward
that end and thus make this international highway a
powerful factor for the preservation of peace.</p>

<p class="indent">To the eminently conservative and disinterested conclusions
of this patriotic English expert, I may be permitted
to give my adherence no less than to the publicly
expressed opinions of the great American statesmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
whose names I have mentioned and to the practically
unanimous approval of the Congress of the United
States, after having actively discussed the Canal question
for twenty years.</p>

<p class="indent">With assurances of my highest esteem I beg to remain,</p>
